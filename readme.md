Math:

The math of this slot machine is loosely based on the Money Honey Bally 742 slot machine. I found an image showing three reels and replaces the images on it with Emoji sports balls. The scores for the Money Honey slot machine were quite conservative with a very low payout percentage. I added some extra win modes.
